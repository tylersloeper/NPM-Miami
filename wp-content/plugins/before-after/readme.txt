This effect requires image height and width to be specified with images, if your img tags conatins those parameters and stil you are having issues with Chrome or Safari web browsers
Enable Automatic Detect Dimensions on Before After Options page and reload your pages.

***Issues with images not showing up or only one image being shown***<br />
Make sure code for both images "img" tag are with in the beforeafter shortcode and one image (image supposed to be before image) has "alignleft" text in "class" attribute of the "img" tag.
